The application should process a specified target text file word-by-word and dynamically swap
every word for its synonym from the Google-1000 list. The similarity between words should be
computed from the reduced set of 59,602 GloVE word embeddings provided. As shown in the
diagram above, this will require loading and processing all word embeddings into a map data
structure, generating a second map that relates each Google-1000 word with its embedding, and
then searching / swapping each word in the target text with its Google-1000 equivalent based on the
highest similarity score. The application must use virtual threads to concurrently process each word
in the embeddings, Google-1000 and target text files. When the target text file has been processed,
the results should be saved to specified file
